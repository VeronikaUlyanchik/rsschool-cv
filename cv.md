## About Me


I graduated with a degree in world economics, specialization in foreign economic activity management at the Belarusian State Economic University.
As part of my studies, I studied 2 foreign languages: English and German. 

Then worked in Alivaria Brewery as a customs specialist from 2019 to 2021.
Also I took courses "Website Development Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript". I liked this direction, therefore I absolutely sure want to develop further in the field of web development. I hope to work as a front-end developer soon.

As a junior specialist, I would like to take part in real projects. I look forward to working in a team of professionals so I can learn from them.

   while (num.toString().length !== 1) {
